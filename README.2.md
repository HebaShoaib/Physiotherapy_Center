# Physiotherapy Center Management System

This project simulates the scheduling and treatment process in a physiotherapy center. It was built as part of a university data structures course using C++.

## My Role
I contributed to the design and implementation of core features, including:
- Patient registration and classification (Normal / Recovering)
- Treatment queue management using data structures (linked lists, priority queues, stacks)
- Handling time-based simulation and treatment allocation
- Handling the flow of the patients & Resoueces from their lists (All Patients, Waiting, Early, Late,..etc)

## Tools 
- C++
- OOP
- Queues, Linked Lists, Priority Queues, Stacks, Arrays
